A convenient Selenium Page Object wrapper framework, that reduces usual waiter, and initialization routine. It will help you to get rid of boilerplate code in UI test automation frameworks.

### Motivation
As a test automation engineer, I hate to write synchronization and wait code, so I want to create quick and stable ui autotests.
I need a robust semantically laconic ui framework that saves me a lot of time during ui web test automation.

I hate to spend time in debug and adjust waiters. I hate it so much. I just want to write tests quickly and easily.

So I finally decide to develop framework that will help to avoid this routine. 
Even though I love it so much, please keep in mind, that any framework it's just a tool, not a panacea, not a lifestyle.

Feel free to leave your comments and feedback.
